# First-Github-Repo
<br>
Hi everyone!  
<br>
I'm Sujal Mhetre.
<br>
<br>
Just a guy figuring out this software thing â€” one commit at a time.  
<br>
This is my first GitHub repository.
<br>
From here on, you'll see my journey of becoming a software developer, going from 0 to 100.  
<br>
So stay tuned!
